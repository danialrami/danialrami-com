I've been working on some new music and wanted to have a way to create a [Spotify Canvas](https://artists.spotify.com/canvas) from my album artwork. This script needed to do a [few things](https://support.spotify.com/us/artists/article/canvas-guidelines/):

- Take album artwork as input (or any still image)
- Resize to 9:16 for phone screens
- Apply the effect(s)
	- random digital artifacting
	- glitches from the [glitch-this](https://pypi.org/project/glitch-this/) library
	- vertical pixel smearing
- output a few different filetypes in a new directory: 
	- png 
	- gif 
	- final mp4 for spotify

Here's an example with the album artwork:

Boom.

Feel free to check out the code, repo linked [here](https://github.com/danialrami/canvas-generator_spotify). The python is open-source, so feel free to use, edit, copy, or anything else. Try some different effects! I'll keep working on it too, probably. I hope this helps someone ü§ù more soon üëè
