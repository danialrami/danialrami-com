I try to listen to new music every day, and I keep a spreadsheet of all the albums I wanna listen to [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1p8zTsGuQVV81tvuZswIHq-pIXCyZn9ixhg-2HWD9X10/edit?gid=0#gid=0). It's managed by the google sheets and apple music apis, python, and synced to my obsidian daily note.

The logic handles the whole lift, so day to day I just add music to my library in Apple Music, see what album comes up in Obsidian, and mark it as done after I listen. I listen to way more music this way! If you want to do something similar, here's exactly how I do it:

## The Setup

{{add the setup to-do}}

I try not to rate the music out of 5 stars or anything like that, cause for me the point is just to listen. While I'm listening in Apple Music, I'll mark songs I like as Favorites, and if more songs end up on my Favorites off the album than not, then I mark the whole album as a Favorite and put a little "ðŸŒž" in Google Sheets. 

I do the same for TV/Movies, and working on doing it for books and games.
